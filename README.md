# NetworkUtility

This project is intended for my own personal exploration of .Net 8 and C#12 features in combination with practicing Git workflows wth CoPilot from within Visual Studio 17.8.0 and best practices in BDD and TDD using Gherkin/Cucumber acceptance criteria in combination with xUnit and FluentAssertions.
